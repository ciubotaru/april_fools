April Fools Mod v0.0.2
======================
A collection of mostly harmless jokes and pranks.

IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. IDEAS WELCOME. CODE WELCOME.

Implemented:
------------
* Sleepwalking -- Once in a while, player's position changes by one block (random player, random direction, random timing). As if somebody's pushing you...
* Fake privileges -- Once in a while, a player receives a message saying that another player granted him/her a non-existent privilege, or revoked a real privilege.

Ideas:
------
* Gift -- adding a random item to player's inventory.
* Tool swap --replacing a wielded tool with something else.
* Other ideas?
