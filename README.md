April Fools Mod v0.0.1
======================
A collection of mostly harmless jokes and pranks.

THERE IS NO CODE SO FAR. IDEAS WELCOME. CODE WELCOME.

Ideas:
------
* Teleport -- changing a player's position by one block (random player, random direction, random time intervals).
* Fake privileges -- message informing a player that he/she was granted a non-existent privilege.
* Gift -- adding a random item to player's inventory.
* Tool swap --replacing a wielded tool with something else.
* Any ideas?
