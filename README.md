A collection of mostly harmless jokes and pranks.

IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. IDEAS WELCOME. CODE WELCOME.

------------
* Sleepwalking -- Once in a while, player's position changes by one block (random player, random direction, random timing). As if somebody's pushing you...
* Fake privileges -- Once in a while, a player receives a message saying that another player granted him/her a non-existent privilege, or revoked a real privilege.
* Random crafts -- Every once in a while, when a players tries to craft something, he/she gets a completely unexpected object.
