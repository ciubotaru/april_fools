April Fools Mod v0.0.1
======================
A collection of mostly harmless jokes and pranks.

IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. IDEAS WELCOME. CODE WELCOME.

Implemented:
------------
* Sleepwalking -- Once in a while, player's position changes by one block (random player, random direction, random timing). As if somebody's pushing you...

Ideas:
------
* Fake privileges -- message informing a player that he/she was granted a non-existent privilege.
* Gift -- adding a random item to player's inventory.
* Tool swap --replacing a wielded tool with something else.
* Other ideas?
